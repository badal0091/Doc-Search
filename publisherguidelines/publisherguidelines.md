# Types of Papers

- Research Articles (full papers)
- Short Original Communications and Discussion Articles
- Review Articles
- Research Communications

Please ensure that the length of your paper is in line with your
research area and with the science presented.

All papers -- excluding Editorials, Letters to the Editor, Conference
Reports -- are subject to peer-review by a minimum of two and a maximum
of three experts.

While submitting your paper you will be asked for three potential
reviewers. Indicating three reviewers is mandatory.

To authors from non-English language countries: To have the best
possible pre-requisition for the review process, please ask a native
speaker to check the quality of the English, before you submit the
complete paper.

## Letters to the Editor

Please provide the following details within your manuscript:

- full title of the article you are commenting on
- corresponding author of the article you are commenting on
- DOI of the article that you are commenting on

The title of your letter should be structured as follows:

- Comments on "Title of the Article" or
- Answer to "Comments on "Title of the Article"

Make sure to cite the article or comment you are referring to in the
reference list of your letter.

## Other contributions

Apart from the strictly scientific contributions as research articles
(short and full papers) and reviews, Journal publishes:

- News & views from research and technology, legislation and
  regulation, hardware and software, education, literature,
  institutions, organizations, conferences.

recommend usingÂ publisher LaTeX template

### Headings

Please use no more than three levels of displayed headings.

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations should be defined at first mention and used consistently
thereafter.

### Footnotes

Footnotes can be used to give additional information, which may include
the citation of a reference included in the reference list. They should
not consist solely of a reference citation, and they should never
include the bibliographic details of a reference. They should also not
contain any figures or tables.

Footnotes to the text are numbered consecutively; those to tables should
be indicated by superscript lower-case letters (or asterisks for
significance values and other statistical data). Footnotes to the title
or the authors of the article are not given reference symbols.

Always use footnotes instead of endnotes.

### Acknowledgments

Acknowledgments of people, grants, funds, etc. should be placed in a
separate section on the title page. The names of funding organizations
should be written in full.

## References

### Citation

Cite references in the text by name and year in parentheses.

### Reference list

The list of references should only include works that are cited in the
text and that have been published or accepted for publication. Personal
communications and unpublished works should only be mentioned in the
text.

Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last names of the
first author of each work. Please alphabetize according to the following
rules:

- For one author, by name of author, then chronologically;
- For two authors, by name of author, then name of coauthor, then chronologically;
- For more than two authors, by name of first author, then chronologically.

If available, please always include DOIs as full DOI links in your
reference list (e.g. "https://doi.org/abc").

> Ideally, the names of all authors should be provided, but the usage of
> "et al" in long author lists will also be accepted:

### Specific Remarks

- Online documents:wikipedia documents are not acceptable as
  references.
- LanguageReferences should be in English with an appropriate title in
  English. If it's in a different language the language should be
  indicated

- Tables should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical
  order.
- For each table, please supply a table caption (title) explaining the
  components of the table.
- Identify any previously published material by giving the original
  source in the form of a reference at the end of the table caption.
- Footnotes to tables should be indicated by superscript lower-case

# Artwork and Illustrations Guidelines

## Electronic Figure Submission

- Supply all figures electronically.
- Indicate what graphics program was used to create the artwork.
- For vector graphics, the preferred format is EPS; for halftones,
  please use TIFF format. MS Office files are also acceptable.
- Vector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the
  files.
- Name your figure files with "Fig" and the figure number, e.g.,
  Fig1.eps.

## Line Art

- Definition: Black and white graphic with no shading.
- Do not use faint lines and/or lettering and check that all lines and
  lettering within the figures are legible at final size.
- All lines should be at least 0.1 mm (0.3 pt) wide.
- Scanned line drawings and line drawings in bitmap format should have
  a minimum resolution of 1200 dpi.
- Vector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the
  files.

## Halftone Art

- Definition: Photographs, drawings, or paintings with fine shading,
  etc.
- If any magnification is used in the photographs, indicate this by
  using scale bars within the figures themselves.
- Halftones should have a minimum resolution of 300 dpi.

## Combination Art

- Definition: a combination of halftone and line art, e.g., halftones
  containing line drawing, extensive lettering, color diagrams, etc.
- Combination artwork should have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi.

## Color Art

- Color art is free of charge for print and online publication.
- Color illustrations should be submitted as RGB.

## Figure Lettering

- To add lettering, it is best to use Helvetica or Arial (sans serif
  fonts).
- Keep lettering consistently sized throughout your final-sized
  artwork, usually about 2-3 mm (8-12 pt).
- Variance of type size within an illustration should be minimal,
  e.g., do not use 8-pt type on an axis and 20-pt type for the axis
  label.
- Avoid effects such as shading, outline letters, etc.
- Do not include titles or captions within your illustrations.

## Figure Numbering

- All figures are to be numbered using Arabic numerals.
- Figures should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical
  order.
- Figure parts should be denoted by lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.).
- If an appendix appears in your article and it contains one or more
  figures, continue the consecutive numbering of the main text. Do not
  number the appendix figures, "A1, A2, A3, etc." Figures in online
  appendices [Supplementary Information (SI)] should, however, be
  numbered separately.

## Figure Captions

- Each figure should have a concise caption describing accurately what
  the figure depicts. Include the captions in the text file of the
  manuscript, not in the figure file.
- Figure captions begin with the term Fig. in bold type, followed by
  the figure number, also in bold type.
- No punctuation is to be included after the number, nor is any
  punctuation to be placed at the end of the caption.
- Identify all elements found in the figure in the figure caption; and
  use boxes, circles, etc., as coordinate points in graphs.
- Identify previously published material by giving the original source
  in the form of a reference citation at the end of the figure
  caption.

## Figure Placement and Size

- Figures should be submitted within the body of the text. Only if the
  file size of the manuscript causes problems in uploading it, the
  large figures should be submitted separately from the text.
- When preparing your figures, size figures to fit in the column
  width.
- For large-sized journals the figures should be 84 mm (for
  double-column text areas), or 174 mm (for single-column text areas)
  wide and not higher than 234 mm.
- For small-sized journals, the figures should be 119 mm wide and not
  higher than 195 mm.

## Permissions

If you include figures that have already been published elsewhere, you
must obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) for both the print
and online format. Please be aware that some publishers do not grant
electronic rights for free and that Publisher will not be able to refund
any costs that may have occurred to receive these permissions. In such
cases, material from other sources should be used.

## Accessibility

In order to give people of all abilities and disabilities access to the
content of your figures, please make sure that

- All figures have descriptive captions (blind users could then use a
  text-to-speech software or a text-to-Braille hardware)
- Patterns are used instead of or in addition to colors for conveying
  information (color-blind users would then be able to distinguish the
  visual elements)
- Any figure lettering has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1

## Supplementary Information (SI)

Publisher accepts electronic multimedia files (animations, movies,
audio, etc.) and other supplementary files to be published online along
with an article or a book chapter. This feature can add dimension to the
author's article, as certain information cannot be printed or is more
convenient in electronic form.

Before submitting research datasets as Supplementary Information,
authors should read the journal's Research data policy. We encourage
research data to be archived in data repositories wherever possible.

## Submission

- Supply all supplementary material in standard file formats.
- Please include in each file the following information: article
  title, journal name, author names; affiliation and e-mail address of
  the corresponding author.
- To accommodate user downloads, please keep in mind that larger-sized
  files may require very long download times and that some users may
  experience other problems during downloading.
- High resolution (streamable quality) videos can be submitted up to a
  maximum of 25GB; low resolution videos should not be larger than
  5GB.

## Audio, Video, and Animations

- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3
- Maximum file size: 25 GB for high resolution files; 5 GB for low
  resolution files
- Minimum video duration: 1 sec
- Supported file formats: avi, wmv, mp4, mov, m2p, mp2, mpg, mpeg,
  flv, mxf, mts, m4v, 3gp

## Text and Presentations

- Submit your material in PDF format; .doc or .ppt files are not
  suitable for long-term viability.
- A collection of figures may also be combined in a PDF file.

## Spreadsheets

- Spreadsheets should be submitted as .csv or .xlsx files (MS Excel).

## Specialized Formats

- Specialized format such as .pdb (chemical), .wrl (VRML), .nb
  (Mathematica notebook), and .tex can also be supplied.

## Collecting Multiple Files

- It is possible to collect multiple files in a .zip or .gz file.

## Numbering

- If supplying any supplementary material, the text must make specific
  mention of the material as a citation, similar to that of figures
  and tables.
- Refer to the supplementary files as "Online Resource", e.g., "...
  as shown in the animation (Online Resource 3)", "... additional
  data are given in Online Resource 4".
- Name the files consecutively, e.g. "ESM_3.mpg", "ESM_4.pdf".

## Captions

- For each supplementary material, please supply a concise caption
  describing the content of the file.

# Processing of supplementary files

- Supplementary Information (SI) will be published as received from
  the author without any conversion, editing, or reformatting.

# Accessibility

In order to give people of all abilities and disabilities access to the
content of your supplementary files, please make sure that

- The manuscript contains a descriptive caption for each supplementary
  material
- Video files do not contain anything that flashes more than three
  times per second (so that users prone to seizures caused by such
  effects are not put at risk)
